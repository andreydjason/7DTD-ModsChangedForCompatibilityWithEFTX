Files of the Mods Changed for Compatibility with EFTX

**BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE REPLACING THEM, JUST IN CASE**

## Instructions:
1 - Click at the green button **\<Code\>** above and download the **.zip**
2 - Unzip it at the Game Mods folder - usually something like: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods**
3 - Replace all files - I guess you can use a mod manager too but I did not tested that.
